# Repository for decision making through active infrence

This repo contains discrete active inference for combining external goals and internal system requirements. The decision making is in terms of the costs to be minimized at the current time. The AiAgent class implements the methods for active inference while adaptive_action_selection implements the algorithm for conflicts resolution. 

The repo contains simple examples to use the class and the adaptive action selection algorithm
